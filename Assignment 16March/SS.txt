In a village, there is a bakery called Sunshine, 
where the people of the village used to come to 
have breakfast every day. Like everyday, the bakery 
is opened early in the morning and the workers in 
the bakery make bread and put it in the bread tray. 
To meet them on the way out, at that time the worker 
in the bakery gives a bread tray to the customer from 
outside, then the customer who comes there eats the bread 
on the spot.While the customer is eating the bread, they 
see all the other breads and panic, after the first one, 
all the bread itself. They try to save one of the breads 
by cleverly changing its shape and pretending to be there 
again when the customer leaves. Finally, it was time to close 
the bakery and the chef who was inz the kitchen comes out. 
He is very hungry and sees the bread. And that chef eats that 
bread
